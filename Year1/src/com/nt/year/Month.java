	==========
	- We  used to define final variables to represent a constant value.
	- When we access those final variables it value is printed 
	which is not meanful for end user
	- to solve this problem enum is introduced

/*
	- Here 5 is printed which is not meaning full. 
	- If we declare Months as enum we will MAY as output

	1. enum  can be created in seperate java file or inside a class
	2. enum can also have methods, in this case ; 
	is mandatory after last named constant
